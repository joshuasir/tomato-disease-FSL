This repo contains an experiment on tomato disease recognition based on a leaf image dataset obtained from Kaggle. The experiment utilizes the easyfsl module, focusing primarily on three algorithms: TIM, BDCSPN, and Relational Network.

## Introduction
Tomato diseases can significantly impact crop yield and quality. Early detection and accurate identification of these diseases are crucial for effective disease management and control. With the advent of deep learning techniques and the availability of large-scale image datasets, computer vision models can be trained to automatically recognize and classify tomato diseases based on leaf images.
